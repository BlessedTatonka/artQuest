! Undefined control sequence.
l.12 \DeclareGraphicsExtensions
                               {.jpg,.pdf,.png}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
